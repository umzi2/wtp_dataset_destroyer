```hcl
  degradation {
    type = "or" #and
    probability_one = 0.5
    probability_two = 0.5
    one_degradation { ... }
    two_degradation { ... }
  }
```
### Type
- `or` - if the first degradation group does not trigger, the second one will be executed.
- `and` - if the first degradation group triggers, the second one will also be executed.
### Probability
- `probability_one` - the chance of triggering the first degradation group (e.g., 0.5 = 50%).
- `probability_two` - depending on the type, if the process moves to the second degradation group, it will trigger with this probability (e.g., 0.5 = 50%).
### Degradatio
- `one_degradation` - a group of degradations that execute if probability_one is triggered. It works the same way as regular degradations but uses a different name.
- `two_degradation` - the second group of degradations, working on the same principle.
- Both `one_degradation` and `two_degradation` can be defined multiple times, for example:
```hcl
one_degradation { ... }
one_degradation { ... }
two_degradation { ... }
two_degradation { ... }
```
